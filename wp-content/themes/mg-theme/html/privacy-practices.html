<div class="txt-28 txt-medium txt-uppercase">OUR PLEDGE REGARDING YOUR PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION:</div>
<div class="txt-20">The privacy of your protected health information or “PHI” is important to us.  This notice will tell you about the ways in which we may use and disclose your PHI,  your rights regarding your PHI.  This Notice is published on our webpage and available at the SUP practice locations.  You will receive a copy at the first point of service and amendments will be made available on our webpage and at the service following an amendment.  </div>
<div class="txt-28 txt-medium txt-uppercase">HOW WE MAY USE AND DISCLOSE YOUR PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION WITHOUT YOUR AUTHORIZATION:</div>
<div class="txt-20">We may access, use or disclose your PHI only as permitted by law.  The following categories describe different ways that we may use and disclose your PHI without your authorization.  Certain disclosures of PHI may be made electronically.  </div>
<ul class="list list-num">
  <li><b>For Treatment:</b>  We may use your PHI to provide you with health care treatment or services.  We may disclose your PHI to other healthcare providers such as pharmacies, physicians, nurses, technicians, health students, or other personnel who are involved in taking care of you.  For example, your primary care physician may need to know your vision results.    </li>
  <li><b>For Payment:</b>  We may use and disclose your PHI so that the treatment and services you receive from us may be billed to and payment collected from you, an insurance company, or a third party.  For example, we may need to disclose your health plan information about your use of our services so that your health plan will pay us or reimburse you for the treatment.  We may also tell your health plan about a treatment you are going to receive to obtain prior approval or to determine whether your plan will cover the treatment.  </li>
  <li><b>For Health Care Operations:</b>  We may use and disclose your PHI to support the business and other healthcare operations of our Practice.  For example, we may use health information to review our treatment and services and to evaluate the performance of our staff and business associates to perform  peer review and quality assessments, accounting, consulting, auditing, licensing, accreditation, investigatory, and other services for the Practice. </li>
  <li><b>Business Associates:</b>  Some of our activities are provided on our behalf through contracts with business associates.  Examples of when we may use a business associate include electronic medical records companies, management services organization, cloud-hosting vendors, coding and claims submission performed by a third party billing company, consulting and quality assurance activities provided by an outside consultant, billing and coding audits performed by an outside auditor, and other legal, administrative and consulting which may arise from time to time.  When we enter into contracts to obtain these services, we may need to disclose your PHI to our business associate so that the associate may perform the job which we have requested.  To protect your PHI, however, our business associate is required to appropriately safeguard your information to the same extent we are. </li>
  <li><b>For Research:</b>  We may disclose your PHI for the purpose of research.  We will only disclose your PHI for research purposes upon your express authorization or if the research protocol has been approved by an institutional review board that has reviewed the research proposal and established protocols to ensure the privacy of your PHI.</li>

Please notify our Privacy Officer if you object to such disclosures.</b></li>
  <li><b>Communication with Family Members:</b>  Sometimes a family member or other person involved in your care will be present when we are discussing your PHI with you. If you object, please tell us and we won’t discuss your PHI while that person is present. There may be times when it is necessary to disclose your PHI to a family member or others involved in your care because there is an emergency or you lack the decision making capacity to agree or object. In those instances, we will use our professional judgement to determine if it’s in your best interest to disclose your PHI. If so, we will limit the disclosure to the PHI that is directly relevant to the person’s involvement with your health care. For example, we may disclose your potential exposure to an infectious disease that warrants immediate attention.</li>
  <li><b>Unlawful Conduct:</b>  Federal law allows for the release of your PHI to appropriate health oversight agencies, public health authorities or attorneys, provided that a work force member or business associate believes in good faith that we have engaged in unlawful conduct or otherwise violated professional or clinical standards and are potentially endangering one or more patients, workers or the public.</li>
