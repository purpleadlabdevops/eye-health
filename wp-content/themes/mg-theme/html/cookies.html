<div class="txt-28 txt-medium txt-uppercase">1.  Cookies, Anonymous Identifiers, Web Beacons, and Other Internet Tracking Technology</div>
<div class="txt-20">We utilize Cookies, Anonymous Identifiers, Web Beacons, and other Internet tracking technology to collect information from a user’s computer, mobile, or other device. </div>
<ul class="list">
  <li>A “Cookie” is a data file that is created and stored on your computer’s hard drive when you visit our Services.  An “Anonymous Identifier” is a random string of characters that is used for similar reasons as Cookies. </li>
  <li>We use Cookies and Anonymous Identifiers to become more familiar with users through the study of analytics. Some portions of the Services require the use of Cookies for proper function.  Anonymous Identifiers can be used where Cookie technology is not available.  You may refuse to accept Cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your web browser.  If you select this setting, you may be unable to access certain parts of our Services.  Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse Cookies, we will issue Cookies when you direct your browser to our Services. </li>
  <li>A “Web Beacon” is an object embedded into a web page or an e-mail that collects various data. A Web Beacon is known by several common terms, such as a web bug, tag, page tag, tracking bug, tracking pixel, pixel tag, web pixel, targeting pixel, re-targeting pixel, and clear gif.  Web Beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, and to monitor how many visitors view our Services. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the device, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages or in e-mails.  When used within e-mail, for example, a web beacon can track whether a user opens a message, clicks on a link within the e-mail, and similar actions.  We may also use other, similar Internet tracking technology to monitor a user’s actions coming to our Services, moving through our Services, and leaving our Services.</li>
</ul>
